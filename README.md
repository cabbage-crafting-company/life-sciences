 - rudimentary model making skills,
 - clamps,
 - level,
 - superglue,
 - silicone,
 - a candle.

# General instructions

We're going to create a silicone toy by 3d printing a mold, then casting the silicone.

## Openscad

Open the file you want to print. You should see the model.

Adjust the model and mold parameters to your heart content.
Saving the file should update the view automatically.
There are no sanity checks built into the files, it must be supplied by you.

After you've settled for the parameters, it's time to export the mold parts.
Select the mold part by adjusting the view parameters, then render the model, then export the stl.
You have to go through all parts one by one.

Now you have some stl files.

## 3D printing

Print all parts, with the correct printing options. Look for details in the model specific section.

## Assembly

Clean up the parts, then glue them together.
There's a recommended order, see below.
Use the key holes to help align the parts.
The key holes are designed for toothpicks, but you can adjust the size.
Use superglue, thinly, and clamps to hold parts together.

After the glue has set, seal all seams and key holes with wax.
Use a candle and drip the liquid wax.
Try to avoid the casting holes.

## Casting

Find a level spot for the mold.
Prepare a batch of silicone.
Pour it in a casting hole, slowly.

For the first half hour or so, you have to keep the situation in check.
Bubbles may rise to the surface and you have to top off the silicone.
A minor leakage can be saved, top it off, again and again, patiently, and the setting silicone will plug it.

## Breaking the mold

After the silicone has set, break the mold, using some pliers or cutters.
The molds were never intended for multiple use.
Remove all parts.
Clean up your new toy.
Remove unnecessary parts with a knife.
Check for major defects.
Check for platic bits stuck into the silicone.
Wash the toy with plenty of hot water and soap.

# Butt plug

The mold has only two symmetric parts.
Support is required.
The casting hole is the whole bottom face.

# Dick squeezer 4 / 5

There is no parameter to adjust the inner diameter of the squeezer.
Compiling the model prints the inner diameter to the log.
It is the function of the outer diameter and the number of lobes.
Increasing either of them increases the inner diameter.

You need to print the outer part twice to form a pipe.
Support is required for the outer part, and use no support for the other parts.
Don't glue the central part to anything.
First, glue the pipe, then the bottom to the pipe, then put in the central part, and glue the top part to the pipe.
Make sure the casting holes and the lobes are aligned.

# Toothbrush wand 1

Put the top in place, then glue the sides together, then glue the top. The top won't fit through the sides glued together.

# Should I do this?

No.
